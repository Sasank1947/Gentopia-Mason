INFO:root:Here's a delicious recipe for **Garlic Tomato Chicken** that features chicken, tomatoes, and garlic. It's simple to make and packed with flavor!

### Garlic Tomato Chicken

#### Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes (or diced tomatoes)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and half of the oregano and basil.

2. **Sear the Chicken:**
   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. 
   - Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   - In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. 
   - Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until it becomes translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.

4. **Add Tomatoes and Seasonings:**
   - Add the cherry tomatoes (or diced tomatoes) to the skillet. 
   - Stir in the remaining oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). 
   - Cook for about 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes start to soften and release their juices.

5. **Combine Chicken and Sauce:**
   - Return the seared chicken breasts to the skillet, nestling them into the tomato mixture. 
   - Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the chicken to heat through.

6. **Serve:**
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.
   - Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.
   - Serve hot over rice, pasta, or with crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

Enjoy your flavorful Garlic Tomato Chicken!
